# TODO: I am wondering if the move here is to actually make this part of the .config repo,
# bring in the config repo, and have this function as an update script as well
# This way it can all be done as one piece
# The thing I wonder about is, it would probably be useful if my config repo could be used
# in multiple types of systems, so maybe still keep it as a separate piece
# I feel more strongly about using this as an upgrade script, though it introduces some
# of the obnoxious variable edits, though we might need those in an upgrade script anyway
# The other problem with making install/upgrade one thing is handling paths
# Something you could do is have a short script to run in sudo to do apt upgrades, then
# Another script for handling unmanaged/less managed software

# TODO: Get the rest of the old scripting

# Questions:
# nVidia drivers
# How to handle file backups (both creating and importing from old system)
# What Chron jobs to setup and how to manage?
# rsync?
# Audio
# Disk management
# Need a note at the end to manually pull Wireguard configs
# Brave bookmarks (saving/importing)
# Brave default pages (I think these just have to be manually done)
# Screenshot program
# File manager
# X11
# lightdm or some other thing for display
# qbittorrent config
# Steam/Games (Are STS and STP Steam or GOG or something)
# Calculator
# Redshift
# Image backgrounds
# I added HexChat for IRC and that's probably fine
# How does i3 display management work?
# Is it not possible to download a Paint clone on Linux?
# It might be helpful to download a GUI package manager for .deb files
